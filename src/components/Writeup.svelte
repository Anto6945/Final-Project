    <p> We have created a scroller that includes 3 of our planned visualizations. 
        Using the template, we created seperate svelte files for each of our visualizations and linked it to our main App.Svelte file. 
        So far, we have cleaned our data by changing the number of arrivals to millions and our two bar graphs has a slider
        that enables a user to pick the year to see the most and least popular countries for international travel. We've finished the basic structure of our project with very simple 
        text and graphs, which we anticipate will have more interactions and details for the final protoype. </p>
    <p> The most challenging part of the project is most probably going to be the 
        depicting the storytelling aspect of the project. We think that integrating 
        the appropriate animations and information to make our project engaging and 
        informative might require lots of time and effort. The animations might be a 
        little difficult because both of us are not too sure how to do them in 
        javascript or svelte. We will have to do additional research about international 
        tourism to add annotations about events like COVID-19 or conflicts that have 
        impacted travel. Also adding features that are make our project more unique and 
        creative might be challenging for us. </p>
