    <p> We have created a scroller that includes 3 of our planned visualizations. 
        We have created the separate files in Svelte and linked them all to the main App.Svelte file.
        So far, we have cleaned our data by changing the number of arrivals to millions and our bar graph has a slider
        that enables a user to pick the year. We've done the basic structure of our project with very simple 
        text and graphs. </p>
    <p> The most challenging part of the project is most probably going to be the depicting the storytelling
        part of the project well. Adding the right animations and information to make our project engaging
        and informative, might take us time to perfect. I think the animations might be a little difficult 
        because both of us are not too sure how to do them in javascript or svelte. We might have to do additional
        research about international tourism to add annotations about events like COVID-19 or conflicts that have
        impacted travel.  </p>
