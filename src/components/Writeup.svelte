    <p> We have created a scroller that includes 3 of our planned visualizations. 
        We have created the seperate files in Svelte and linked them all to the main App.Svelte file.
        So far, we have cleaned our data by changing the number to millions and our bar graph has a slider
        that enables a user to pick the year. The most challenging part of the project is most probably going 
        to be the visualization.
